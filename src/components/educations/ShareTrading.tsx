        <Contents desc="The â€˜traditionalâ€™ method of buying and selling company shares sees an investor purchase a stock and wait for an increase in the value, in the hope of making a profit. This relative long-term strategy means you hold the stock for a period of time so to have partial ownership in that company." />
        <Contents desc="Some stocks will provide income in the form of dividends even if the stock has lost market value. You can use this income to fund other investments or reinvest." />
        <Contents desc="The huge rise of simple financial derivatives based on an underlying market have opened up financial markets to a mass of people who may not have accessed them before." />
        <Contents desc="Share spread betting allows traders to simply speculate on whether a stock price will move up or down. You're betting on a range of possible outcomes." />
        <Contents desc="Share CFDs are based on the underlying market where traders buy or sell contracts which represent an amount per point in that share price. This is similar to what you do when share investing, but you do not have any ownership of the company." />
